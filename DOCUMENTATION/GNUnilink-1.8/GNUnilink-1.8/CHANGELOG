Release 1.8
-----------
Enabled watchdog, to reset the PIC if not pinged for more than
(approx) 2.8 seconds.

Uses universal responses to ANYONE and APPOINT. Changed SERIAL
OUPUT to match those of the PRJC project.

Can now support either CD or MD depending on state of PORTA/3 
(pin 2 on 16F...). 5v = CD, 0v = MD.

LONGNAMES now work, but only with MD emulation.

Release 1.7
-----------
More changes and code improvements, and hopefully at least a few
of them work. I've also spent some effort in shrinking the code
down so that more features can be squeezed into 1K parts.

Bit the Bullet and purchased a new (well to me anyway) unit
XR-C33R, and I can confirm that in CD mode this unit works
including Disk Name. This unit does not like MD mode, don't
know why.  My XR-C450RDS continues to work, but without the text.

Had report of sucess from a XR-C500RDS and hopefully this is 
indicative of other units. This unit also appears to work with 
MINIDISK mode, but is yet to display text names.

Found out that as well as the track number being in hex for MINI
DISK, so is the minutes of the counter. But the seconds is in 
decimal..... weird system!!


Release 1.6
-----------
Big changes to the layout of the file (and hopefully not too many
bugs). Now split into a series of files hopefully to make editting
easier.

Started with MiniDisk emulation, although this does not appear to 
work with my head unit. Adjusted the Serial Input to allow for 
upto 255 tracks when in MiniDisk mode.

Improved the receiving code to handle all the lengths of command,
this is required to process the medium and long commands.

Changed the output serial names to be more generic, you can change
these to what you want in 'functions.asm' but beware of code length
as it's close to filling a '627.

Plus some general formating and code optimisations.


Release 1.5
-----------
Serial IN and OUT now working with suitable PIC (tested on 16F627).

Baud rate 19200, no parity. Hardcoded but value can be recalculated.

Serial_Out issues strings on CD+, CD-, Seek+, Seek-. Again hard coded
but as Null terminated strings - change to whatever you want.

Serial_In sets the disk, track and counter. Disk and track names may
work but are untested as my unit does not support them. Commands are
as follows:
 	'd1'	-	sets disk 1
 	't 5'	-	sets track ' 5'
 	'c1234'	-	sets counter to '12:34'
 	'Dthisdisk' -	sets disk name
 	'Tthatsong' -	sets track name

I'd be particularly interested if any one has the text working, you
should be able to switch between numbers and text with the 'disp'
button.

Release 1.4
-----------

More tidying... you'd believe that I was a tidy person, but then you 
haven't seen my play room ;-)

Found out why the 16F627 isn't updating the display, but have only
implemented a hacky solution, it is failing to issue a SlaveRequest.

I've also added the starting bits of using the buttons to control a PC, 
no serial output as yet but the button presses change what is displayed 
on the screen.

Release 1.3
-----------

A few more bits of tidying up.

Oh and the display now does something ;-) Should display the CD name 'GPL 
2001' and track name ' AUX-IN ', although it doesn't on my head unit - I
hope that this is due to my unit not supporting CD Text although it does
RDS names. The Track Time should flick between 0:00 and 23:45, this does
work on my unit!

The volume/tone/mute/etc all work, but the PIC doesn't recieve any key 
presses other than source, at which point it is deselected. Reselecting
it works, and will run though the display sequence again.

If you have a head unit with a CD already in it you may have to modify
the response to the slave poll to allow for a different ID being allocated.

Release 1.2
-----------

Further Tidying and correcting of the code, mostly in the build system and
the '#if's for processor selection. The PIC type and speed can now be 
selected at the head of the file, this should be the only change needed.

I have successfully run this code at 5.6MHz, 8MHz and 10MHz. I even have
a report of it 'working' at 9.2Mhz from 'Mode'.

The absolute acuracy of the timing loops is not required, just pick the 
closest to what you're actually using.

The file HARDWARE describes how to connect the PIC to the radio, note that
the BusOn signal must now be connected for the code to work.

Release 1.1
-----------

This is the first version of GNUnilink that actually functions, that is that 
it enables the AUX Inputs to be selected/deselected by pressing the Source 
button.

Unfortunately the display is frozen during AUX input, i.e. it remains in the 
state it was before pushing the Source button. Whilst frozen like this the 
Source, Volume and Off buttons still function so you can still use the Head 
Unit to some degree. Pushing Source again will select the next source 
(Radio, Cassette).

We're working on getting at least some indication of the AUX inputs on the 
display.

Still only tested at 10MHz on a C-XR450RDS, I would be interested of reports 
at other speeds (see the start of the code for adjusting it to your speed) 
or on other Head Units.

Issue 1.0 11th October 2001
---------------------------

Initial Issue, not yet proven to function. Though does at least decode a few
commands from the Head Unit and attempt to reply to 2nd 'Anyone' enquiry.
